Comments:

I was happy to see that the team is on the same page and collaborating
well. I suggest you put more effort into preparing for the second
interview, so that it looks and sounds more professional.


The team introduction was done well. I suggest that you focus more on
the profesisonal aspects of the team for the second interview.

The reasons for selecting the project were presented well, although
only after my quesitons.

The project was introduced well. I suggest you practice the demo in
preparing for the second interview, to make sure it goes smoothly and
looks more professional.

You presented convincing arguments for choosing the software process.

You answered my questions on the software process well. It would have
been better to hear all the arguments from you without my prompts.

I also suggest you prepare to make sure all team members are equally
prepared to present / answer questions about the software process.
